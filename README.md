# Castle Falkenstein system for Foundry Virtual Tabletop
Enter a world of another universe just a few steps away from our own; a place where Dragons and Steampower rule the skies, Faerie Lords duel atop the battlements, and where the forces of Wizardry and Magick meet the gaslight streets of Sherlock Holmes' London. This is a place of Swashbuckling Fantasy, High Romance and Alternate History; the world of **Castle Falkenstein**!

## Installation
To install this system, copy its Manifest URL at the bottom of Foundry VTT's "Install System" dialog:

## Release notes
See [CHANGELOG](./CHANGELOG.md)

## Supported languages
The system supports localization. At this stage, the following languages are supported:
+ English
+ French<sup>(1)</sup>

<sup>(1)</sup> Translations of compendium packs (list of abilities & spells) require the 'Babele' module to be installed and activated.

To submit translations for other languages, see [Contributions](#contributions) below.

## Dependencies
In order to benefit from all features provided by this system, you need a Cards UI cutomization module with which the Castle Falkenstein system is pre-integrated.

By default, the system uses enhanced sheets for **Hands** and **Cards** (since they're customized) and leaves core ones for **Decks** and **Piles** (since they are not customized). But you may use the enhanced sheets for **Decks** and **Piles** also if you wish.
