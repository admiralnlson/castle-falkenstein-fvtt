### Bugs

### Derived stats & Racial abilities (a.k.a 'Other' tab)

+ `[S]` Extra 'Other' tab for listing secondary attributes such as Speed (Run+Flight) or Languages known (see below)

  + compute health automatically incl. Dragons' +2
  + limit Dragon sorcery to 5 cards drawn
  + list species features such as Dwarf's immunity to Fire, Fae sensibility to Iron in the sheet, ..
    + Faerie Powers
      + potentially split "Fae" into "Fae (generic) / Fae (Brownie) / Fae (Pixie) / Fae (Lord/Lady)" for extra setup of non-generic Fae characters.
    + Dwarf Powers
    + Dragon
      + Flying
